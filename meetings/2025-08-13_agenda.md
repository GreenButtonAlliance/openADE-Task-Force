## ESPI Support for Steam Data
* Work on how to report Steam data using Green Button is under way
    * Steam data can be reported using the ESPI UsagePoint resource
        * The UsagePoint can be associated with a MeterReading and ReadingType resources
        * The ReadingType resource can specify the type of data being reported
        * The UsagePoint can also include a ServiceLocation to specify where the steam is being used
    * Currently working on how to measure the amount of steam used
        * Steam usage can be measured in various ways, such as:
            * Volume (e.g., cubic feet or cubic meters)
            * Mass (e.g., pounds or kilograms)
            * Energy content (e.g., BTUs or Joules)
        * The choice of measurement method will depend on the specific application and the available data
    * Once the measurement method is determined, examples of how to report steam using the ESPI standard will be created
        * These examples will be posted as a technical article on the GBA website
        * Samples of ESPI XML data covering all steam use cases will be provided
    * The goal is to have the technical article and examples completed by the end of September
